    - box and whiskers (method on x, score on y over n trials)
    - success and time to run vs. n (number simulations in mcts)
        - find "golden" n value
        - for time, try both to run one step vs. total run
    - Add more below if you think of anything
- Documentation
    - Write up - Description of problem and reason(s) for choosing your algorithm as a solution method 
        - stochastisity and large potential state space
